# Primary:

* Correctness

## Short-term:

* Closures implementation
* Function composition
* * For composition to work everywhere type inference for lambdas is required
* Control flow operator `?`
* Map operator `<#>`

## Long-term

* Floating point
* Memory management
* * retain/release calls must be balanced
* Basic type inference
* Constant bindings
* Simple optimizations
